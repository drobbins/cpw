## Basic Computer Skills

Before you can begin learning to program and create web content, you have to learn the environment in which those activities will take place.

## The Skills

### Files

Files are blocks of data in a computer. A file is a collection of 1's and 0's that all go together. These 1's and 0's could represent any number of things:
* pictures
* programs
* documents
* libraries (special kinds of programs used by other programs)

Files are identified by thier names. Most filenames look like this: filename.abc. The part of the filename before the '.' is just a name, but the part after the '.' is special. This part is called the extension, and the computer uses the extension to figure out what type of file it is:
* .txt is a text file
* .jpg is a picture file in the JPEG format
* .doc is a Microsoft Word document
* .exe is an executable file, or program

Some files can be "executed"; the computer can use the data in the file as instructions (i.e. a program).

### Folders

Folders are used to store files. Every file is in a folder, and a folder can store many files. Folders can also store other folders, so you can make a nice heirarchy to organize your stuff.

Folders are sometimes called Directories. Folders are directories, directories are folders. We will use both words here to train ourselves to think of them as the same thing.

All computers have at least one root or top-level directory. Unix based computers (Linux and Apple) have only one, while Windows computers may have more than one. The top-level directories are called:
* "/" for Unix based systems
* "C:\" for Windows systems

#### Paths

How do you identify where a file or folder is? By a path. A path is a description of the location of a file or folder, starting with the root directory of the system:

/somefolder/anotherfolder/file.txt
C:\folder1\folder2\file.txt

#### Home Folders

In most operating systems, every user has a special folder just for them. This is called their home folder.

#### Folder Structure

Unix Based Systems:

/bin
/usr
/home
/var
/tmp

Windows Based Systems:

C:\Windows
C:\Programs and Files
C:\Users (Vista and 7) or C:\Documents and Settings (XP)

## Working with Files and Folders

Files can be created, copied, moved, and deleted. Some files can be opened for editing, while others can be executed as programs.

Folders, likewise, can be created, copied, moved, and deleted. You can also enter a folder to view it's contents.

### Command Line

Unix

* cd
* ls or dir
* cp
* mv
* rm
* mkdir
* rmdir

Windows

* cd
* dir
* copy
* move
* delete
* mkdir
* rmdir
