### Course Introduction

This class is about what you want to learn. Specifically, what you want to learn about computers, the Internet, programming, and how to tie them all together. If you don't want to learn about those things, don't take this class.
Goals

Since this class is about what you want to learn, you choose the goal. Since this class is part of your high school experience, your instructor gets to make sure your goal is hard enough that you'll learn something interesting, but not so hard that you have no hope of finishing.

Your goal must include making something. Sometimes this is called a project, but in this case you're (hopefully) making something you want to use. Impress me.

### Grading

|Letter  |Percentage  |Total Points (out of 1000)  |

[GradingTable]()

Weekly Assignments (20) : 25 pts (2.5%) each
Project                 : 500 pts (50%)
Total Points            : 1000 (100%)

Bonus points may be offered if the instructor is merciful. If offered, bonuses will be announced and offered to the entire class.

You can earn up to an additional 50% extra credit on any coding assignment by completing it in multiple programming languages, where possible (e.g. Ruby and Javascript, Python and Javascript, etc.) You will find it much easier to understand the fundamental concepts of programming if you take advantage of this extra credit.

### General Instruction

For each week, create a sub-folder in your main Github repository. In that weekly folder, create additional sub-folders as needed containing the examples, exercises, and extensions you've completed while reading (see below)

When you a reading, do the examples and exercises. Better yet, extend the examples and make them your own. You have two class periods a week to work on them, use them wisely.

Don't be afraid to learn more than one computer language at a time. Instead, think about how something you saw in one language could be expressed in another. There usually isn't much difference.

Keep in mind that if you put something on the web, it's probably not private anymore. Use wisdom, especially when posting info about someone else.

Your feedback and input is very welcome, especially where it leads to improvement of this course. Keep in mind, however, that the instructor has the final say in all things course related.
Lab Hours

Class meeting times on Tuesday and Thursday are labs. That means you are responsible to use the time wisely, either completing reading and assignments or working on your project.

I expect that you will commit something to Github by the end of each lab. Your submission may not be working, but it should indicate that you were.

During lab hours, I will most likely be online on Skype and Google+. Feel free to ask me things.

### Things you Might Choose to Learn

#### Seeds

* Write an app for Chrome or Facebook
* Write a SMART Platforms app
* Become a contributor to an open source project
  * or start one (e.g. a jQuery plugin)
* Build your own web page (at your own domain)
* Learn a programming language your instructor doesn't know
  * e.g. [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
* Respond to a [request for startup](http://ycombinator.com/rfs.html)
* Build that website or app you always wish existed
* Read and understand [SCIP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

#### Default Goals

These are what you have to do if you can't think of anything better that interests you. Please realize you are probably wasting your time and mine if you don't get any further than this list; ideally as you progress through this material you'll think of something cool to make, and that will become your new project.

* Familiarity with Javascript, HTML5, CSS, and jQuery
* Ability to discover new knowledge required to accomplish a web development task using web-available documentation.
* Creation of 2-5 page portfolio demonstrating learning in this class and others.
* Ability to independently create modern (i.e. interactive) web content.
* Ability to discuss fundamental programming concepts, and use them in several languages
    * Literal Values
    * Types
    * Variables
    * Functions
    * Objects
    * Arrays
    * Control Structures (e.g. if, while, for)
